1: dataloader and optimizer (standard and adam)
2: CUDA tutorial 
3: CUDA tensor ops

4: make make a tensor "spirit graph" that pre runs all the computations in a model once so tensors can be deleted right after they will last be used in the graph. this saves
code complexity for all the delete intermediates and training and testing diffs and anchor system. also saves memory.
