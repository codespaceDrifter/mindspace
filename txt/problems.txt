0: no customized parallel min/max operations
1: no in place operations (i.e. for add equal)
2: no "no grad" option. some stuff like initial data and masks cost extra memory
3: maybe operations need to be part of an operations hpp and cpp file cause this means not having to code in place operations seperatedly. maybe. depends of cuda.
4: there is no training mode memory saving support. intermediate values are not deleted right after they are used, only after a complete forward pass.



gonna fix:
0, 1, 2, 3



slice does not work because if lazy broadcasting stride to 0 offset does not change anything
