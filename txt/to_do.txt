dont know what is wrong with deep_equal idx error

1: transformer blocks, tests for blocks, save load: THURSDAY

the rest: FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY

2: CUDA tutorial 
3: CUDA tensor ops



unrelated:
make a razor extension the underclocks cpu and sets settings to save power


MODEL SAVE LOAD: 
blocks save structure:
Block ID
block type size
block type
Sub Block ID Size
Sub Block ID list
Tensor Id Size
Tensor ID list

tensor save structure: (only save tensors that do NOT have a view)
tensor ID
data size
data
shape size
shape


ORDER:
blocks: BFS


Block A contains B, C. B contains D.
