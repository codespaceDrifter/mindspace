0: no customized parallel min/max operations
1: no in place operations (i.e. for add equal)
2: no "no grad" option. some stuff like initial data and masks cost extra memory
3: maybe operations need to be part of an operations hpp and cpp file cause this means not having to code in place operations seperatedly. maybe. depends of cuda.
